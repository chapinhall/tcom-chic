# Welcome to the `tcom-chic` Repository!

TCOM stands for Transformational Collaborative Outcomes Management. It is an approach grounded in a philosophy of a single shared visionâ€“helping people achieve their health and wellness goals as they navigate healthcare, child welfare, justice, behavioral health, education, and other complex systems. To learn more about TCOM and current events, see the [TCOM Conversations](https://tcomconversations.org/) website.

Led by Dr. John Lyons and his team, TCOM's home is at [Chapin Hall at the University of Chicago](https://www.chapinhall.org/). However, our active community is as broad as the dozens of state and agency partners which provide services to children, youth and families across the United States and internationally.

This repository is intended to be a resource for TCOM's CHIC (Collaborative Helping Information Center) group to share programming code and tutorials that enable our partners to make meaning, and communication around action in ways that are easier, cheaper, and more effective. It is our hope that this repository become a focal point for these efforts as technology creates new opportunities for collective action, as well as collaboration even in making these tools.

## Contributing to this repository

The most effective way to benefit from--and contribute to--this resource is to become familiar with [git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) as a version control system, and [GitHub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub) which is an internet-based platform allowing many stakeholders to collaborate.

Some free tutorials that we recommend are:

* [tryGit](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1), created by CodeSchool, which is a light and interactive way to try out `git` that does not require any downloads or installation
* [Hello World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/), created by GitHub, which provides clear, essential basics on using `GitHub`
